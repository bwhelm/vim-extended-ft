vim-extended-ft
================

This plugin adds the following behaviour to the default behaviour of the `f`, `F`, `t`, and `T` commands:
- Multiline - Can continue searching using `;` and `,` keys across multiple lines
- Smart Case - When the search character is lower case it matches both lower and upper case, and when the character is uppercase it matches only upper case.

Customization
- If you have remapped any of the f/F/t/T/;/, keys you can still use the plugin without changing it, just remap to the <plug> mappings found in vim-extended-ft.vim
