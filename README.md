vim-extendedFT
================

This plugin makes the following changes to the default behaviour of the `f`, `F`, `t`, and `T` commands:
- Multiline - Can continue searching using `;` and `,` keys across multiple lines
- Smart Case - When the search character is lower case it matches both lower and upper case, and when the character is uppercase it matches only upper case.
